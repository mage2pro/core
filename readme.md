`mage2pro/core` is a unique middleware that bridges the gap between the out-of-box [Magento](https://github.com/magento/magento2) / [Adobe Commerce](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) software and the needs of real-world information systems.   
It is the main result of my everyday work with Magento / Adobe Commerce for 14.5 years, since 2010.
## Do I need it?
You will benefit from it if you operate an information system based on Magento / Adobe Commerce: 
- an online store 
- a backend information system for trading on marketplaces
- a B2B information system
- a corporate information system (e.g. ERP)
