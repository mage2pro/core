`mage2pro/core` is a middleware between [Magento](https://github.com/magento/magento2) / [Adobe Commerce](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) and information systems developed on their basis.  
This is the main result of my everyday work with Magento for 14.5 years since 2010.
## Do I need it?
You need it if you operate a Magento / Adobe Commerce based information system: 
- an online store 
- a backend information system for trading on marketplaces
- a B2B information system
- a corporate information system (e.g. ERP)
