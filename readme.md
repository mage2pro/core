`mage2pro/core` is a unique middleware that bridges the gap between the out-of-box [Magento](https://github.com/magento/magento2) / [Adobe Commerce](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) software and the needs of real-world information systems.   
It is the main result of my everyday work with Magento / Adobe Commerce for 14.5 years, since 2010.
## Do I need it?
You will benefit from it if you operate an information system based on Magento / Adobe Commerce: 
- an online store 
- a backend information system for trading on marketplaces
- a B2B information system
- a corporate information system (e.g. ERP)
## What will it do for me?
It serves 2 main purposes: 
- It improves the quality of Magento / Adobe Commerce based information systems.
- It makes extending the functionality of Magento / Adobe Commerce based information systems easier. 
## How will it improve the quality of my information system?
`mage2pro/core` significantly enhances the self-diagnostic capabilities of Magento / Adobe Commerce.  
`mage2pro/core` catches every failure of Magento / Adobe Commerce, comprehensively explains them, and carefully stores the reports for further analysis by your programmers.  
The `mage2pro/core` reports are in no way comparable to the traditional Magento / Adobe Commerce `system.log` and `exception.log` files.  
By using `mage2pro/core`, you will significantly reduce the time and money spent on troubleshooting Magento / Adobe Commerce failures, making your system more efficient and cost-effective.  
`mage2pro/core` will inform you about important problems that the original Magento / Adobe Commerce sometimes ignores (e.g., your customers' problems when paying in your store: this is the most obvious case where you lose money).

## How will it make the extension of my system's functionality easier?
I have been programming Magento / Adobe Commerce every day since 2010.  
Every day, when I solve a new task I have not done before, I store my solution in the software library of `mage2pro/core`.  
`mage2pro/core` contains all my experience with Magento / Adobe Commerce.  
My solutions have been rigorously tested in numerous information systems based on Magento / Adobe Commerce.  
By leveraging the `mage2pro/core` library, your programmers can access solutions that are usually superior to what they can develop themselves (and even more so find on StackOverflow or generate via ChatGPT).
